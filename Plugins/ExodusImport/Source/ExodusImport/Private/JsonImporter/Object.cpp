/*
Notes:
* An object without an owner will be created as transient, that includes components.
* A transient object will poof eventually.
* In order to make component visible, it has to be registered in an Actor, so the actor creates render/physics state for it.
* In order to show up in unreal editor, object must be registered as an instance component.
* Changing outer to another object can be safely done when object is not registered yet. There's an owner check within the component, it throws an assert when owners mismatch.

Basically, we can totally create all objects as transient, and then alter owner, BUT, we'll need to take care of registering them and instance registering them.
Likewise the components can be created in vacuum, but if we want to see them, we msut register them, if they should be editable in hierarchy, they should be added as instance component,
and when they're registered, they can no longer be safely moved to another outer (can unregister them though).

Currently the system tries use correct outer right at the beginning, as a result the Outer is provided via a callback. This can be and likely should be simplified in the future.

We've ... actually I've run into a pickle.

It goes like this:
* Scene graph constructed from multiple actors cannot be automatically harvested into a blueprint.
* Harvesting objects into blueprint opens blueprint editor (troublesome with a lot of blueprints)
* Apparently skinned mesh can crash the whole process.

So, there's a need of major overhaul.

First, there's a category of situations where objects will need to be reconstructed as a single actor, with actor node being enabled for root.
This happens in case of prefabs, or prefab instances.

Question remains how to track non-prefab objects linked to prefab instances. But this can wait for later.

In a situation where we're dealing with a prefab instance, we'll have to create a root at the bottom AND spawn empty scene nodes as components.
As contents are no longer working as folders.

Additionally, we would want to track situations where there's a single object with a single component that spawns a specialized actor.
This is not strictly necessary, but desirable, so lights will be point light actors and not actors.

Additionally, there's trouble with ownership. It seems that creating component as part of transient package and then switching ownership 
to a non-transient package causes that component to disappear. I kinda wonder why, perhaps I missed a part where I update number of gc links or something.

Therefore, we need to create a blank actor IN ADVANCE, and use that blank actor as an owner to all the child components.

Additioanlly, previously discarded version where I attempted to create chidl components with specifying owners had a glitch where the components created this way were not properly registering in the scene.

So. I scrapped the whole branch, and started over.

To summarize the rules:
* an object spawns actor instance, if it is not part of a prefab instance and has components.
* an objects spawns nothing, if it is not a part of a prefab instance, and has no components.
* an objects spawns components, if it is a part of prefab instance. 
* prefab instance has AActor as its base class, EXCEPT the situation where it is dealing with a single component object...? 

Hmm... (-_-)

Current plan - disable creation of prefabs.
Add handling of prefab instances according to those rules.

	Let's summarize collision approach and differences.

	Unity has separate rigidbody component.
	Unreal does not. Instead, random primitives can hold properties which are transferred to rigidbody.
	Unity has separate mesh collider component.
	Unreal does not.
	Also, apparently in unreal mesh may not have collision data generated?

	Unity creates compound bodiess by attaching colliders to the rigibody found.

	Unreal.... apparently can mere colliders down to some degree.

	So, what's the approach.

	In situation where phytsics controlled entities are present - or if there are collides present...
	Most likely resulting colliders should be joined into a hierarchy, where the first collider holds properties of the rigidbody from unity.
	The rest must be attached to it in order to be merged down as colliders.
	What's more, all the other components such as lights should be attached to that first "rigidbody" component, which will serve as root.

	So, in order to do it properly, we'll need to first build colliders. Then build static mesh.
	Then make a list out of them, and parent everything to the first collider then pray to cthulhu that this works as intended.
	The root component should also be set as actor root.

	Following components, such as probes, lights and whatever else are ALL going to be parented to that root physic component, whether they're actors or components themselves.

	This is ... convoluted.

	Let's see if I can, after all, turn rigibody into a component instead of relying on semi-random merges.
